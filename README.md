#LogicBot

###LogicBot is a web-based logical programming environment.

In most programming environments, there exists a dichotomy between the area where a user creates and edits a program, and the area where a user observes and manipulates its output. This dichotomy forces the user to form a mapping between these concepts, understanding how a change in the program will alter its output, and learning through feedback. What if this dichotomy was removed, enabling the user to create and interact with a program in the same place?

A LogicBot program is a kinetic creature composed of a logical circuit. By placing and connecting simple components, the user can control the behavior of the creature, programming it to move in different ways. By allowing the user to create and interact with the program in the same place, feedback becomes instantaneous and intuitive, advocating a playful and exploratory creative process.
