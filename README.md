#Storybook

###Storybook is a prototype for a new kind of visual programming environment for young children.

It is a tool that enables the creation of interactive stories that take advantage of the built in sensors on mobile devices.

The interface does not rely on traditional text to generate dynamic behavior. Instead, colored buttons which represent different operations are connected visually into a chain, forming a procedure.
